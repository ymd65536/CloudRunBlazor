## Overview

## install gcloud

First, install gcloud using curl.

```bash
curl -sSL https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash && exec -l $SHELL && gcloud init
```

Then, log in with gcloud.

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

You can find your Project ID on the Google Cloud Welcome page.
â€»Check [welcome google cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?)

The correct command is:
```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

For example, if your project ID is `my-awesome-project-123`, you would run:
```bash
gcloud config set project my-awesome-project-123
```

This command sets the active Google Cloud project for all subsequent `gcloud` commands.

Next, you will set up Application Default Credentials (ADC).

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

This completes the setup. / The setup is now complete.

### Google Cloud Project ID

If you are not using a `.env` file in this project, set the following environment variables directly in your terminal before running the Slack app.
If you are using a `.env` file, you can skip this step as the `PROJECT_ID` will be set automatically when you run the app.

Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variables.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=`gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)'` && echo $PROJECT_ID
```
